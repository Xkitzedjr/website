    First post in a while. This semmester I've been taking Abstract Algebra I, Physical Math I, and Electronics. My favorite has deffinetly been Algebra, and least
    favorite is PMath; I've just been lost most of my time in Electronics. I've also left my job in retail and (tentativly) started as a (paid) intern programmer for the
    state and started working on making a game.
