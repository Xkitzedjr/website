    <h2>End of Week 6</h2>

    <p>
      The past three weeks have been an introduction to quantum mechanics. We went over classical wave optics, the wave nature of light, the particle nature of light, matter waves, and quantum math. Wave opticts is something
      I vaugly remember from Phys II but I don't think it made much sense to me at the time. This time, however, it sunk in a bit more, probably because I really took the time to understand all the derivations every step of
      the way. Optics are very geometrical in nature and I've always found geometry to be less intuitive than algebra or calculus. Many equations make sense to me in a way where I don't need to memorize them per say, but I
      somewhat reconstruct or rederive them when needed. Optics on the other hand, always seemed like a collection of random equations that you plug in numbers to, particularlly wave optics and diffraction. I realized that
      quantum mechanics depends heavily on waves and I should finally understand diffraction before diving into quantum proper.

      The photoelectric effect is something else I feel I didn't really understand when I attempted this class before. Everytime I've encountered it I remember being told that "Light behaves like a particle, so the electrons
      ejected by a photon depend on the photon's energy, not the amplitude of a classical light wave. Here's the euqation". But why does treating light as a particle explain the photoelectric effect? I actually found a pretty
      good explanation while reading a different book than we use in class (which is why I now always make sure to have multiple sources to pull from when studying any subject). For those who don't know, the photoelectric effect
      is the emmission of electrons by a metal when you exposed to light. If light were composed of waves, you would expect the energy of an ejected electrion to be coorilated with the amplitude of the wave. So if the wave was
      very tall then the electrons comming off the metal would be moving very fast. In the same way a boat in the ocean would be displaced by a tiny amount if the water waves were very short but would capsize if the waves were
      much taller than the size of the boat. But, that isn't what we see, what we do see in experiments is that the speed of the electrons is determined by the frequency of the light, ie how far apart the waves are spaced. The
      higher the frequency the faster the electrons comming off the metal are, and below a certain frequency we don't see any electrons at all. At first I didn't really understand how this implies that light can behave as a
      particle. Here's the explanation that helped me: Imagine a light wave is made up of a bunch of particles, the amplitude of the wave determines how many particles there and the frequency determines the energy of each
      particle. Imagine many people are standing in a gynasium and I'm trying to knock them down by throwing dodge balls at them. If I wimply throw a few dodge balls at them, I won't knock anyone down of course. What if I
      increase the amount of dodge balls I'm throwing? If I'm randomly throwing the balls, most will only git hit by by a couple balls, and getting hit with a couple of weak throws isn't much more than getting hit by one weak
      throw. As I increase the amount of balls thrown I'm increasing the amount of people I'm hitting and how many times I'm hitting them, but each individual ball is doing practically nothing to knock anyone down. So I decide
      instead of doing many weak throws, I will just a few very powerful throws. Now I'm not hitting very many people, but as long as my throws are energetic enough I'll knock down anyone I hit. You just think of the frequency
      of the light wave as determining the energy of the individual photons making up the wave.

      Next we talked about matter waves, which has a kind of funny story of discovery. A french Theoretical Physics PhD student name DeBroglie (pronounced deebroy) took the idea of mass energy equivelence and applied it to
      the particle/wave nature of light. Since light energy can behave as both a particle and a wave, and special relativity make no distinction between mass and energy, matter that behaves as a particle should also have a
      wavelike characteristic. His advisor didn't believe his hypothisis but thought it was rigerous enought to publish. A few years later and an unrelated experiment, which itself had been altered from its original purpose
      because the researchers broke their equipment, ended up accidentally verifying DeBroglie's matter wave hypothisis. There really wasn't much to this section, just finding the wavelength of massive particles.

      Next we went over some math needed for quantum, namely complex numbers and eigenvalues/eigenvectors. I feel like Euler's equation for the complex exponential is like vectors, a concept which is widely used but has no
      real set introduction point. So every class that needs it spends a bit of time going over it for the people who haven't seen it before. Personally, this was my fourth time seeing this in class, and my second time going
      over eigenstuff. An easy week, especially considering it was short due to the 4th and we had no homework that needed to be sumbitted.

      Finally, we went over spin and representing measurements with matrices. This had been the most difficult part of quantum so far. The math itself is pretty easy but the notation takes some getting use to and you can
      no longer rely on your physical intuition to predict what the resault should be. Often when you get done with a calculation or derivation you examine it and ask yourself "does this make sense?". In quantum, the most
      I can do now is make sure that the probability isn't something completely rediculus like more than one or negative. Spin itelf is quite unintuitive. For some reason, the electron seems to have an intrinsic angular
      momentum even though it has no volume and it couldn't possible be spinning that fast. And it is always found to be in aligned with the axis that you are measuring. The concept behind matrix mechanics doesn't make
      much sense to me at the moment either. A measurement can represented as a matrix, the only possible outcomes are the eigenvalues of that matrix, and the determines the after state of the electron which is itself
      an the corrisponding eigenvector of that eigenvalue. I don't see where this comes from. Unlike Newton's 2nd or Maxwells equations, where once you understand the math and what the equations are saying they make sense,
      I don't see how one could derive matrix mechanics from experiment. Not only that, but spin is a special observable which only has two possible outcomes, however there exist observables, like postition, that have
      infinitely many values they could take on, one for each point in space, and are thus represented by an (uncountabily?) infinitely large vector. This is an area which I have no previous experience in so I'm sure its
      going to feel unintuitive for a while before I get the hang of it.

      Next week we will be going over the wave function and the Schrodinger equation. Only two more weeks of summer classes then a month long break before the fall semmester starts.
