    <h2>End of Week 3</h2>

    <p>
      I'm three weeks in to my return to school. Currently taking just one class, Physics 3: Modern Physics at the local community college.
      it is an 'accelerated course' or thats what they call it. They currently only offer coures that last for 8 weeks instead of the normal 16.
      I have class four times a day, Mon - Thurs, an hour each day.

      The last three weeks we have been going over special relativity. We just finished up and next week we will be starting on quantum mechanics.
      I have attempted this class twice before but withdrew only a few weeks in both times. All three times we started off learning SR but this is
      the first time I've felt like I was really understanding the material. I think this is mostly due to the book being used. Looking over two
      other books that I used before they have either one or two chapters devoted to SR. The book for this class on the other hand is one entire
      book devoted to just SR, nine chapters total.
