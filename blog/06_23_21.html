    <h2>End of Week 3</h2>

    <p>
      I'm three weeks in to my return to school. Currently taking just one class, Physics 3: Modern Physics at the local community college.
      it is an 'accelerated course' or thats what they call it. They currently only offer coures that last for 8 weeks instead of the normal 16.
      I have class four times a day, Mon - Thurs, an hour each day. We cover about a chapter a day, and there are typically ~20 HW problems per
      chapter. Luckilly, we don't have to turn in 60 problems each week, just one. We upload a worked solution for one problem of our choosing
      to the website a week and recieve feedback from others, or usually just the professor. This means I can get away with skipping the tedius
      problems (like solve this problem, then solve it again with different numbers to plug in). We get extra credit for formatting our homework
      in LaTex and I've taken advantage of this every week so far. The professor has decided to combine quizes and midterms into weekly super-quizes
      (or mini-midterms) every monday. We've taken two so far and I've made a perfect on both. Should I go for an straight eight ace?

      The last three weeks we have been going over special relativity. We just finished up and next week we will be starting on quantum mechanics.
      I have attempted this class twice before but withdrew only a few weeks in both times. All three times we started off learning SR but this is
      the first time I've felt like I was really understanding the material. I think this is mostly due to the book being used. Looking over two
      other books that I used before they have either one or two chapters devoted to SR. The book for this class on the other hand is one entire
      book devoted to just SR, nine chapters total. The book really takes the time to explain the mechanics of SR in a completely natural way.
    </p>

    <p>
      The book of course starts off with Galilian relativity, but it spends a <em>whole chapter</em> on the topic, as well as when and why it fails.
      I feel this is a very important but often overlooked topic. Usually, classical relativity is given a ten minute overview and then the discussion
      immedately moves on to &gamma factor and lorentz tranformations between frames. The problem is, how is a student expected to learn the intricicies
      of special relativity if they've never been formally expossed to classical relativity? The concept seems simple enough at first, if I throw a ball
      at a speed of 10mph while in a train moving 100mph, how fast is the ball moving relative to someone on the ground? But what if we start asking deeper
      questions, for example: is momentum conserved in a moving reference frame? Does the type of motion determine if momentum is conserved? What about
      mechanical energy?
    </p>

    <p>
      SR is built up in such a way here that it seems almost obvious and that you could have discovered it yourself. I relies heavily on spacetime diagrams,
      graphical intuition, and physical principles. The &gamma factor is not discussed until chapter four, and lorentz contraction is not discussed until
      chapter six. This probably seems extremely slow paced compared to most other modern physics classes, but I can say that I finally understand what
      the hell a proper time and proper length are.
    </p>

      The bonus points for LaTex have got me to finally put some real effort into learing the language. Really, we only need to insert a bit here or there
      in our HW for equations but I've been diving deep into it. I decided I should try to rewrite my notes in LaTeX and I'm about 50% done after starting
      Thursday. It has been a great learning experiece for both learning LaTeX and cementing the past three weeks in my mind. I've rewritting them stricly
      for my own benifit in the future. There won't be a comprehensive final so it isn't really needed for this class but I'm glad I'm doing it anyway. I
      will probably continue this for future classes. Rewritting in three week chunks seems like a good pace, but we'll see with the slower classes at OU.
      Doing diagrams in it has been a real pain though.

      4-Momentum has been the most interesting yet confusing topic is SR by far. I find it interesting that, when reconstructing the basic laws of mechanics
      in an SR framework, conservation of momentum is chosen to be the basis for dynamics, not Newton's 2nd. The way information is encoded in the 4-Momentum
      vector is also strange to me. The time component represents energy and the spactial component represents traditional momentum. The total energy is the
      kinetic plus the rest mass, and the velocity is the ratio of momentum to energy. These relations are definetaly where my understanding of SR is the most
      rocky, I'll be rereading this chapter for the next week. I can finally understand whats going on in this Andrew Dotson
      <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnLJoeBE_BM">video</a>, and its pretty cool that
      I'm finally at a point to start learning about tensors.

      Looking forward to quantum next week. Hope that cat is ok.
